### Summary of Copulation Experiments with wild caught flies



### Brief Methods used:
  Wild population of flies used collected in 2014 in Southern Ontario. Predators used were zebra jumping spiders (*Salticus scenicus*) were collected along warm sunlight walls around McMaster University campus and fed laboratory flies.
  
  Two same aged virgin flies were video recorded for 30 minutes above four 4 cm petri dishes within an enclosed bin with either spiders in the modified petri dish or no predators, manually scoring for copulation latency and duration.
  
### Prediction:

  In the presence of a predator, mating pairs will copulate at a lower rate compared to flies with no predators present. Copulations that do occur will be much quicker in duration in comparison.
  
### Summary of (cleaned) data:

```
Date --> Day
Replicate --> Replicate 
Vial --> Bin replciate (1-4)
Fly_ID --> Unique FlyID
Cop_latency --> Time to copulation start
Cop_Duration --> Length of copulation
Treatment --> Treatment (spider or control)
copulationSuccess --> 0 = no copulation, 1 = copulation
```
