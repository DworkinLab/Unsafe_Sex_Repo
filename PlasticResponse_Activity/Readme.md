### Summary of all activity data collection of wild flies

### Brief Methods:

  Using the **DAM**, the activity of flies was measured with different comparisons due to different cues present in vials. Comparisons looked at Spider Cues vs. No Cues, Mantid Cues vs. No Cues, Cricket Cues vs. Spider Cues, and a 4 way comparison between Cricket Cues vs. Conspecific Fly Cues vs. Spiders fed Crickets Cues vs. Spiders fed Flies Cues. The hourly activity was compared between light and dark phases and the daily trends in activity is found. 
  
### Prediction:

  In the presence of predator cues, flies will lower activity levels in order to avoid (percieved) predator detection compared to no cue controls and neophobic controls.
