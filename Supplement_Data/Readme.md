## Summary of additional data collected and additional information

*May not all be included in the end (some info may be redundant so ignore)*

### Methods:

  The methods for these experiments can be found with the Experimental methods

### Additional Experiments:
  
  **Predator Activity**
  
  Additional data collection was done for measuring the activity of the predators used through experimentation (Predator_Activity). 
  
  **Predator Avoidance**
  
  An additional set of experiments was done with the goal to determine the genetic variability of *Drosophila* to avoid predators.
  
### Additional Information:

  **Plastic Courtship and Copulation Videos**
  
  Figshare has all videos taken of mating pairs with ~15 minute videos of courtship and ~30 minute videos of copulation
  
  Will add to figshare short clips of mating pairs showing courtship and copulation behaviours
  
  Will add to figshare videos of pairs responding to predators in assay chamber
