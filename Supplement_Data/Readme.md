## Summary of additional data collected and additional information

*May not all be included in the end (some info may be redundant so ignore)*

### Methods:

  The methods for these experiments can be found with the [Experimental methods](https://github.com/PaulKnoops/Unsafe_Sex_Repo/tree/master/Experimental_Methods)

### Additional Experiments:
  
  **Predator Activity**
  
  Additional data collection was done for measuring the activity of the predators used through experimentation ([Predator_Activity](https://github.com/PaulKnoops/Unsafe_Sex_Repo/tree/master/Supplement_Data/Predator_Activity)). 
  
  **Predator Avoidance**
  
  An additional set of experiments was done with the goal to determine the genetic variability of *Drosophila* to [avoid predators](https://github.com/PaulKnoops/Unsafe_Sex_Repo/tree/master/Supplement_Data/Predator_Avoidance).
  
### Additional Information:

  **Plastic Courtship and Copulation Videos**
  
  [Figshare](https://figshare.com/collections/Plastic_Response_of_Drosophila_Mating_Behaviours_with_or_without_predators_/4076162) has all videos taken of mating pairs with ~15 minute videos of courtship and ~30 minute videos of copulation. Also has short clips of mating pairs showing courtship and copulation behaviours. There is also examples of a mating pair responding to preators, showing some behaviours believed to be in response to predators.
