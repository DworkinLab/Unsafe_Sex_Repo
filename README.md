### The goal of these experiments are to determine:

  **A)** The plastice response *Drosophila melanogaster* show toward a percieved threat from predators, specifically zebra jumping spiders (*Salticus scenicus*) and Chinese praying mantids (*Tenodera aridifolia sinensis*)
  
  **B)** The evolved response flies selected upon by many generations of exposure to predation.

In this Repo, 6 sub-repositories hold the data and scripts for 6 experiments looking at the plastic (**PlasticResponse_**\*) and evolved (**EvolvedResponse_**\*) responses. 

All the plots can be viewed from **ALlBehaviouralPlots.Rmd** and the summary statistics from **AllBehavioural_ModelSummary.Rmd**. 

Methods are present in **Experimental_Methods** repo and some supplementary data can be found in its own repo as well (**Supplement_Data**).
