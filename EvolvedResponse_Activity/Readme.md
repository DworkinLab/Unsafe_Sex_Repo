## Summary of data collected for activity of evolved flies

### Brief Methods:

  Using the **DAM**, the activity of experimentally evolved flies was measured with no predator cues present. This presents the evolved change preation has caused on the selected flies. The hourly activity was compared between light and dark phases and the daily trends in activity is found. 
  
### Prediction:

  Selection from predators will lower the overall activity of flies as low activity flies will be captured/detected less by the visual predators that rely on active hunting (spiders) and ambush hunting (mantids).
