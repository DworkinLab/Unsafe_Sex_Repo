## Outline of experiments and summary of data for Plastic Response to Spider predators

### Brief Methods used:

  Wild population of flies used collected in 2014 in Southern Ontario. Predators used were zebra jumping spiders (*Salticus scenicus*) were collected along warm sunlight walls around McMaster University campus and fed laboratory flies.
  
  Using immature females (under 24 hours old, reject all copulations), male courtship displays were recorded.
  
  At 8:00 am, a male was added (via aspiration) to a modified 4 cm wide petri dish that has a layer of mesh separating the flies (on top) and a spider (if present) on the bottom, with a video recording from above. Videos were scored for 15 minutes of mating pair behaviours, recording each courtship bout and length of bout.
  
### Prediction:

  Males will display a lower  proportion of time courting and number of courtship bouts in the presence of predators. 

### Data Layout after cleaning:
```
Date --> Day of experiment
Replicate --> Independent Replicate
Vial_number --> Vial Observed (1-4 based on placement)
Observation.Initiation --> Start of observation of vial (start recording)
Treatment --> Treatment (Predator or control)
Court_sum --> Total time courting in 15 minutes
count --> number of independent courtship bouts
court_prop --> Proportion of 15 minutes courting
